## About Hugo

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build my personal website. 

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

## Deploy way

The way I deploy my blog is [Host GitHub User or Organization Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#host-github-user-or-organization-pages).

In this way, I create two separate repos.
  - one for Hugo’s content, https://github.com/memoex/blog/
  - and a git submodule with the `public/` folder’s content in it, https://github.com/memoex/memoex.github.io
